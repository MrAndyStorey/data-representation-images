    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>All data on a computer is represented as binary digits, and images are no exception. 
        This pages looks at concepts such as <b>Image size</b>, <b>Resolution</b>, <b>Colour Depth</b>, and <b>Metadata</b> providing some real-life examples of how these affect the images that you see on a computer screen.</p>

        <h3>Image size</h3>
        <p>Images stored on a computer, smart phone or tablet are made up of pixels. Each pixel is represented by a binary number.</p>       
        <p>&nbsp;</p>       

        <h3>Resolution</h3>
        <p></p>       
        <p>&nbsp;</p>       
        
        <h3>Colour Depth</h3>    
        <p></p>       
        <p>&nbsp;</p>       

        <h3>Metadata</h3>    
        <p>Metadata is data about data.  Many files contain extra data, and in many cases, the images taken with digital cameras and/or smartphones contain rich information as well as the visible pixels.
        This image metadata is stored in EXIF (Exchangeable image file format) and here we have use a Python library called <a href="https://pypi.org/project/exif/">exif</a> to extract the data such as:</p>
        <uL><li>camera model</li><li>date taken</li><li>height and width</li><li>resolution</li></uL>
        <p>The information below has been extracted from the original photo <i>{{ filename }}:</i></p>
        <table>

            {% for key, value in metadata.items() %}
            <tr><td>{{ key }}</td><td>{{ value }}</td></tr>
            {% endfor %}

        </table>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
